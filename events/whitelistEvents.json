    "description": "Our July meetup was a huge success, but not everything was perfect and  we got very valuable feedback from our attendees. We will incorporate that feedback into our slides and repeat the meetup once more in August. We had many people on the waiting list and some couldn't make it last minute - this is your second chance!! Please only fill out this form if you really intend to come. We have only 40 seats available and we want to reach as many women as possible. A pros pros women: This is a PyLadies workshop and obviously it is aimed to mentor female developers in Singapore. We are in the early stages of building up this community and the demand seems to be huge, therefore, due to limited slots available, we cannot accept RSVPs from male developers, YET.",
